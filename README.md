# Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

Hello, I'm Jonathon Watterson, a data enthusiast passionate about transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights. I specialize in data analysis and data science, with a focus on improving business decisions and outcomes through robust data-driven strategies.

## About Me 📖

- **Profession:** Data Analyst & Data Scientist
- **Skills:** 
  - **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), R
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
  - **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow
  - **Data Wrangling:** SQL, data cleaning, and preprocessing
- **Interests:** I'm particularly interested in applying data science to solve challenges in the environmental and educational sectors.

## My Projects 🚀

Here are some of the projects I've worked on that showcase my capabilities:

1. **Sentiment-Analysis-BERT:** This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using BERT, a state-of-the-art language model for natural language processing. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, loading a pretrained BERT model, and fine-tuning it for sentiment classification. It is tailored for intermediate Python users with experience in libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch. The project leverages a cloud-based environment to provide practical, hands-on experience in implementing machine learning solutions for text data. Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!

2. **COVID-19 Analysis (in R) — Local and Global:** This repository contains an analysis of COVID-19 data at the national, state, and county levels in the United States, as well as global data. The analysis examines the progression of COVID-19 cases and deaths using data from The New York Times and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.
